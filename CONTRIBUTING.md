# 🤝 Contributing

Please take a moment to read this guide before making contributions.

## 🧩 How to Contribute

1. **Discuss first** - Before starting a major change, please open an issue or discuss it with the team.
2. **Branch off `main`** - Create a feature branch for your changes.
3. **Keep it clean** - Run `npm run lint` before pushing to ensure code consistency.
4. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** - Describe your changes clearly and link any related issues.

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code passes the linter (`npm run lint`) and builds without errors.
2. Update documentation (e.g. `README.md`) if your changes affect usage or setup.
3. At least **2 developers** must review and approve your PR.
4. Once approved, you should merge your own PR into `main`.
